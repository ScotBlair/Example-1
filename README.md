Example 1: Slow Personal Computer

- Intake<br />
The customer Robert Moore has submitted a support ticket for a slow personal laptop.  He is upset that after the new update, Windows is slow to start up and that apps are taking a long time to load.

- Assignment and Communication<br />
The admin Scot Blair has looked over the ticket and filed it under the "Personal Computer Issues" help topic.  Scot then assigns the ticket to John Doe in the Support department due to its low level of severity.

- Working the Issue<br />
John Doe's first thought after viewing the ticket is that the computer needs to be restarted to clear out the memory cache.  If this does not resolve the issue, then he may have to Remote Desktop into Robert's pc and check the system's resources in Task Manager.  A restart is the simplest first step to take.

- Resolution<br />
John Doe reaches out to Robert Moore and informs him that a restart may be all that is required to resolve the issue and explains why.  Robert restarts the computer as instructed and tells John that it now runs faster and apps load quicker.  John marks the ticket as Resolved.
